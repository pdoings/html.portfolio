<h1>The Best Movie According To Felix</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Best Movie Of all Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Tribe called Judah</h3>
<p>The power of storytelling resonated here, so much that I could kiss the scriptwriter for such a straightforward and relatable piece. The unconditional love the single mother had for her sons and the love they had for her in return was the driving force of this movie.</p>

<h3>The Black Book</h3>
<p>It accomplishes its objectives through its unique storyline, captivating action scenes, innovative camera angles, and engaging dialogue. The movie draws inspiration from popular films like John Wick, The Equalizer, and possibly Sicario.</p>

<h3>The Blood Sisters</h3>
<p>Blood sisters is a beautiful well put together film that manages to kill so many birds all at once. It manages to deliver top notch acting from some of Nigeria's finest, clean cinematography, roller coaster drama and gritty violence while also showcasing the beauty of Nigerian culture and scenery.</p>
